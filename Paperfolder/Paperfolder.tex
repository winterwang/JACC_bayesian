% If you would like to post an early version of this manuscript as a preprint, you may use preprint as the journal and change 'submit' to 'accept'. The document class line would be, e.g., \documentclass[preprints,article,accept,moreauthors,pdftex]{mdpi}. This is especially recommended for submission to arXiv, where line numbers should be removed before posting. For preprints.org, the editorial staff will make this change immediately prior to posting.

% Abstract (Do not insert blank lines, i.e. \\)
\abstract{A single paragraph of about 200 words maximum. For research
articles, abstracts should give a pertinent overview of the work. We
strongly encourage authors to use the following style of structured
abstracts, but without headings: 1) Background: Place the question
addressed in a broad context and highlight the purpose of the study; 2)
Methods: Describe briefly the main methods or treatments applied; 3)
Results: Summarize the article's main findings; and 4) Conclusion:
Indicate the main conclusions or interpretations. The abstract should be
an objective representation of the article, it must not contain results
which are not presented and substantiated in the main text and should
not exaggerate the main conclusions.}
